    title: 'Bing Translation Error Angers Saudi Arabia',
    description:
      'Microsoft’s search engine Bing has placed Microsoft Corporation in dilemma with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through a mistranslation. When the Arabic word “Daesh” (the Arabic acronym for the so-called Islamic State) was typed into “Bing Translate”, the English translation would appear as “Saudi Arabia”, according to “Khaberni” Site. That technical error made a fuss in Saudi Arabia, when many Saudi social media users called for a boycott of Bing and Microsoft. Microsoft Corporation has issued a formal apology to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, describing the error “unintentional”.  In consequence, Mamduh Al-Najjar, officer of Microsoft’s Saudi Arabia branch, expressed his rejection towards anything that might offend Saudi Arabia. Moreover, Microsoft rushed to amend the incorrect translation and opened an investigation to prevent such incidents in the future. However, the translation may considered correct to many critics who have accused Saudi Arabia of funding “Daesh” directly and by taking limited action to prevent private donors from sending money to the group. Currently, it is estimated that around 2,500 Saudi nationals to be fighting with “Daesh”. Besides the general dissatisfaction of the Kingdom’s relationship with “Daesh”, Saudi Arabia is part of a coalition of 34 Muslim nations formed to fight the extremist militant group – a position seems to be slightly complex for Bing to maneuver?',

Must have experience in grammar and syntax, and the signs of both languages; source language and target language, as well as knowledge of each geographical region of the individual speaking.These devices must have the ability to update and add vocabulary immediately, copy all translations immediately, and enable the user to take notes and save additional information during use. It is preferred in these devices to translate colloquial language and phrases and slang texts. In addition, these devices should be obtained at a reasonable cost at the operational and installation level.The institution that asks suppliers to provide ideas about this magical device is not the space fleet command, but the US Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). On July 20, 2016, the US Federal Bureau of Prisons - a subsidiary department of the US Department of Justice - launched an "Application for Information" on "Automatic Language Translation".The US Federal Bureau of Prisons is a law enforcement agency responsible for arrest and execution of federal criminals accused of crimes at the national level ranging from identity theft, drug trafficking to terrorism. It consists of 122 correctional institutions, a central office and 32 other relevant offices, whose mission is to supervise nearly 200,000 federal prisoners.Slator has reached the US Federal Bureau of Prisons to learn more about the state of use of the technology. "The US Federal Bureau of Prisons, in accordance with its policy, monitors the contacts of prisoners to ensure that they do not involve any form of further criminal activity, and this coverage covers both written and verbal communication, and with regard to communications written in foreign languages, translation services are required .
